  "content": "Explain embryonic development  Embryonic development is the process by which a fertilized egg develops into a fully formed organism. It is divided into several stages, including the zygote stage, the blastula stage, the gastrula stage, the neurula stage, and the embryonic stage.Zygote Stage: The zygote stage begins with fertilization, the union of a sperm and an egg. The fertilized egg, called a zygote, contains all of the genetic information needed to form a new organism. It then undergoes several rounds of cell division, called cleavage, to form a ball of cells called a blastomere.  Blastula Stage: The blastula stage begins with the formation of a blastula, a hollow ball of cells with a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel. The blastula then undergoes a process called gastrulation, in which certain cells move to the center of the ball, forming the gastrula.  Gastrula Stage: The gastrula is a three-layered structure, consisting of an outer layer of cells called the ectoderm, a middle layer called the mesoderm, and an inner layer called the endoderm. These layers give rise to all of the different cell types and organs in the developing organism.Neurula Stage: The neurula stage begins with the formation of a primitive streak, a thickening of the ectoderm at one end of the gastrula. This marks the beginning of the formation of the nervous system. The neural plate, a flattened region of ectoderm, then forms on top of the primitive streak.  Embryonic Stage: The embryonic stage begins with the formation of the neural tube, a hollow structure that eventually gives rise to the brain and spinal cord. The mesoderm gives rise to the muscles, bones, blood vessels, and other organs. The endoderm gives rise to the lining of the gut and the respiratory and urinary tracts.  It's important to note that the exact timing and sequence of these stages may vary among different species. In human, embryonic development lasts about 8 weeks and it is a complex process that is tightly regulated by a series of genetic and environmental factors."
